                <span style="font-weight: bolder">SAN ANTONIO, TX</span> - Madeline Mealey is the 2023 4A State Champion in the Girl's 100 Butterfly. The path to gold however, was not one conventionally taken.
                A week before the 15-4A District Meet, Maddie tore her rotator cuff during practice, causing uncertainty about whether she would be able to qualify for Regionals, much less win State.
                At the District meet, she had to start in the water, and placed 5th with a time of 1:09.72, failing to automatically qualify for Regionals. Only after Chloe Jones (who placed 4th with a time of 1:09.08) scratched her event, did Maddie even qualify for Regionals.
                One week later at the Region 4-4A Meet, she was back in the water, placing 2nd with a time of 1:00.35. Going into State, Maddie was seeded 2nd behind the same person who beat her at Regionals. After Prelims, she was seeded 3rd with a time of 1:00.35.
                Maddie needed to go her best time or faster to win gold, all with a shoulder injury that obstinately remained after almost a month. During her Finals swim, she swam the first 50 in 27.65 seconds, still in 2nd place to her competitor from Regionals,
                and returned in 30.99 seconds, almost a body length (and 2 seconds!) ahead of her competition, taking first place. If this is not the greatest comeback ever, I'm not sure what is.
